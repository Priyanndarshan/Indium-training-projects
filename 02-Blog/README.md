# Blog Project

This folder contains a simple blog application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates basic CRUD operations, API interactions, and Promise handling in JavaScript.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the blog UI.
- `index.js`: JavaScript file for blog functionality.
- `script.js`: Additional scripts for blog operations.
- `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the blog UI.
- `server/`: Contains mock database files (`db.json`, `db2.json`, `db3.json`) for simulating backend data.
- `src/`: Contains JavaScript files demonstrating Promise methods:
  - `api.js`: API interaction logic
  - `promiseAll.js`: Example using `Promise.all`
  - `promiseAllsettled.js`: Example using `Promise.allSettled`
  - `promiseAny.js`: Example using `Promise.any`
  - `promiseRace.js`: Example using `Promise.race`

## Features

- Blog post creation, editing, and deletion
- Fetching and displaying posts from mock server
- Demonstrates various Promise methods for handling asynchronous operations

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the blog UI.
2. Use the scripts in `src/` to experiment with different Promise behaviors.
3. Mock server data is available in the `server/` folder for testing API calls.

## Requirements

- Modern web browser
- No external dependencies required
